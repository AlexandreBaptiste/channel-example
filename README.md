What's channels?
https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/core/extensions/channels

During the development of a project, I had think about how handling concurrency between mutliples threads without having an external queue manager. 
We used a database oriented solution but it didn't feel natural neither the right way to do it.

I stambled into channels while doing some monitoring and wanted to give it a go.
